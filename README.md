7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
nothing special but there are instructions for each gesture:
- one hand pointing goes to journal page
- two hands pointing goes to the home page
- open hand opens the new entry
- one open and one closed toggles bookmark
- closed hand sends the entry
- one closed and one pointing opens the date picker
- two open shows entries and two closed hides entries


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
We designed our app for the type of user who loves to write.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
The two custom gestures we created was one that utilized one open and one closed hand. This toggles the
bookmark feature we create to bookmark certain journal entries. The other custom gesture was one closed hand
and one pointing hand which opens the date picker.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
Our app follows principles of good UI design as we did our best to make sure the gestures made sense
to the action they were doing hoping to make those gestures intuitive.
